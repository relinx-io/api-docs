# Relinx REST API Documentation

## Introduction
This repo contains [Relinx](https://relinx.io) REST API documentation.

To use this API please register at [Relinx](https://relinx.io) and add an API Key to your [account](https://app.relinx.io/account).

## API Keys
* API Keys are used to authenticate to the system, so keep your API Keys secret
* Only add an API Key to your account if you're using API access
* Remove unused API Keys
* Consider rotating API Keys periodically
* Regenerate API Keys on any suspicious activity
* API Keys are in the form `id.key`. For example `vHU8cOfU1YgxH6uS.qR5ZvjbVM4HkKQoQ-jLMX7mklAELsXdDb-OQB3BHHROyaZNLEJ-SMTKgiQ7O6UxNaWs-XcA3dan9G0jHPleV`
* We store the `id` part in plain text (for you to identify your keys) and the whole key hashed. The key is generated and shown to you in plain text only once. We're not able to recover it, so make sure to note it

## Versioning
* All APIs have a version (initially `v1`) specified in their URL
* Adding non-breaking changes such as optional field, required field with a default value, returning an extra value, etc, will not result in a new version
* New versions will be introduced on breaking changes (i.e. `v2`, `v3` and so on)
* We'll try to maintain backward compatibility as long as possible. In cases when it's not possible End-Of-Life date for a deprecated API will be announced
* Consider watching (and starring ðŸ˜‰) this repo to get notified on changes and addition of new APIs

## Usage
* Base URL to prefix all URLs in this documentation is [https://api.relinx.io](https://api.relinx.io)
* All APIs starting with the `/auth` prefix require the `Authorization` header to be set to "`ApiKey YOUR_API_KEY`"
* Nearly all APIs require `workspaceId` custom header to be set to the current Workspace ID. See [Get All Workspaces](workspaces/all.md) to get Workspace ID
* Common constants used by APIs are described in [CONSTANTS](CONSTANTS.md)
* Unless stated otherwise all `PUT` requests behave like `PATCH`, i.e. update only fields present in the request body and leave other fields intact
* `DELETE` operations are permanent, though the log is retained.
